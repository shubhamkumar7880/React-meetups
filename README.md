# React-meetups

This is a meetup app that is made using Next.JS and Next/Router.
              It is a single page application in which we can add and schedule
              different meetings with their picture, location and the meeting
              description. We can also view these meetings in details. All
              meetings details are stored in mongoDB database and also these
              meetings are fetched directly from the mongoDB on the app.
